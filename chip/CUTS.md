# Chip capture cut points — the record

Hand-maintained source of truth for where each capture was cut and where
its loop returns. The pipeline re-derives these from frame data on every
regeneration and stamps them into each `.notes.txt` header — **compare a
fresh regen against this table; a mismatch is a flag to investigate, not
something to silently accept.** (A regen after tool changes may shift a
seam by a hair legitimately — but it should be explainable.)

"Cut at" = capture end (also the loop anchor in the song's .rollnotes when
the target isn't bar 1 beat 1). "Loops to" = where playback returns.
Verified 2026-08-02 (Josh by ear + frame-exact register data agreeing).

Notes:

- **ship** — bare pulse1 pickup once (A4, A#4 on beats 1–2), then on every
  loop pass the pickup returns with the body's accompaniment sustaining
  under it (hardware truth). The cut keeps the accompanied pickup.
- **battle** — bars 1–3.3 are a once-only intro; the descending run before
  the seam is the body's turnaround, played every pass.
- **gameover** — 2-beat once-only pickup, then a clean 8-bar loop.
- **victory** — 1.5-bar intro; articulation varies per pass (detector
  needs its period hint in dump-all.mjs HINTS).
- **gurguvolcano** — the transcription has 21 bars but the chip loop is
  exactly 20 at 150; the 21st MIDI bar was the arranger's (same as
  gameover's extra bar).
- **epilogue** — through-composed with tempo changes/fermatas no single
  grid can follow: kept at raw hardware timing (only bar labels are
  approximate). All other songs are grid-snapped.
- Tempos are loop-calibrated (period ÷ verified bar count) except where
  marked grid-fitted.
